# A* Pathfinding Algorithm Visualization

This project is a visualization of the A* pathfinding algorithm using Python and Pygame. The program allows you to set up a grid, place start and end points, add barriers, and watch the algorithm find the shortest path between the start and end points.

## Features

- Visualizes the A* pathfinding algorithm on a grid.
- Allows users to interactively place the start, end, and barrier points.
- Dynamic visualization of the algorithm's process in finding the shortest path.
- Reset the grid or clear the path to experiment with different configurations.
